## A word about Privacy

This YouTube plug-in leverages the Google's YouTube Iframe API, which in turn will allow you to set a regular YouTube URL. However, this URL sets a tracking cookie by default (for marketing purposes).

This alone represents a compliance issue for the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and potentially for browsers with more strict privacy policies.

This plug-in has an option to disable the cookie in the settings, which in that case is recommended to use in this case: `nocookie`; however, this is only one of the multiple steps to achieve an experience that is according to what Privacy Policy expects.
